  abstract={We present the SFI++ data set, a homogeneously derived catalog of photometric and rotational properties and the Tully-Fisher distances and peculiar velocities derived from them. We make use of digital optical images, optical long-slit spectra, and global H I line profiles to extract parameters of relevance to disk scaling relations, incorporating several previously published data sets as well as a new photometric sample of some 2000 objects. According to the completeness of available redshift samples over the sky area, we exploit both a modified percolation algorithm and the Voronoi-Delaunay method to assign individual galaxies to groups as well as clusters, thereby reducing scatter introduced by local orbital motions. We also provide corrections to the peculiar velocities for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist bias, making use of the 2MASS Redshift Survey density field to approximate large-scale structure. We summarize the sample selection criteria, corrections made to raw observational parameters, the grouping techniques, and our procedure for deriving peculiar velocities. The final SFI++ peculiar velocity catalog of 4861 field and cluster galaxies is large enough to permit the study not just of the global statistics of large-scale flows but also of the details of the local velocity field.}

  abstract={Distance measures on a coherent scale around the sky are required to address the outstanding cosmological problems of the Hubble constant and of departures from the mean cosmic flow. The correlation between galaxy luminosities and rotation rates can be used to determine the distances to many thousands of galaxies in a wide range of environments potentially out to 200Â Mpc. Mid-infrared (3.6 Î¼m) photometry with the Spitzer Space Telescope is particularly valuable as a source of luminosities because it provides products of uniform quality across the sky. From a perch above the atmosphere, essentially the total magnitude of targets can be registered in exposures of a few minutes. Extinction is minimal and the flux is dominated by the light from old stars, which is expected to correlate with the mass of the targets. In spite of the superior photometry, the correlation between mid-infrared luminosities and rotation rates extracted from neutral hydrogen profiles is slightly degraded from the correlation found with I -band luminosities. A color correction recovers a correlation that provides comparable accuracy to that available at the I band (~20% 1Ï in an individual distance) while retaining the advantages identified above. Without color correction, the relation between linewidth and [3.6] magnitudes is M b , i , k , a [3.6] = â20.34 â 9.74(log W i mx â 2.5). This description is found with a sample of 213 galaxies in 13 clusters that define the slope and 26 galaxies with Cepheid or tip of the red giant branch distances that define the zero point. A color-corrected parameter ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/765/2/94/apj460586ieqn1.gif] {$M_{C_{[3.6]}}$} is constructed that has reduced scatter: ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/765/2/94/apj460586ieqn2.gif] {$M_{C_{[3.6]}} = -20.34 - 9.13 ({\rm log} W_{mx}^{i} -2.5)$} . Consideration of the seven calibration clusters beyond 50Â Mpc, outside the domain of obvious peculiar velocities, provides a preliminary Hubble constant estimate of H 0 = 74 Â± 4Â kmÂ s â1Â Mpc â1 .}

  abstract={We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant from 3.3% to 2.4%. The bulk of this improvement comes from new near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNeÂ Ia), more than doubling the sample of reliable SNeÂ Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation based on â¼300 SNeÂ Ia at zÂ <Â 0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical and NIR, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST -based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC 4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST /FGS, HST /WFC3 spatial scanning and/or Hipparcos , and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant from each is 72.25Â Â±Â 2.51, 72.04Â Â±Â 2.67, 76.18Â Â±Â 2.37, and 74.50Â Â±Â 3.27 km s â1 Mpc â1 , respectively. Our best estimate of H 0Â =Â 73.24Â Â±Â 1.74 km s â1 Mpc â1 combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC, yielding a 2.4% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is 3.4 Ï higher than 66.93Â Â±Â 0.62 km s â1 Mpc â1 predicted by ÎCDM with 3 neutrino flavors having a mass of 0.06Â eV and the new Planck data, but the discrepancy reduces to 2.1 Ï relative to the prediction of 69.3Â Â±Â 0.7 km s â1 Mpc â1 based on the comparably precise combination of WMAP +ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift measurements and our local determination of H 0 at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early universe in the range of Î N effÂ âÂ 0.4â1. We anticipate further significant improvements in H 0 from upcoming parallax measurements of long-period MW Cepheids.}

abstract = {Abstract The investigation of individual heterogeneity in vital rates has recently received growing attention among population ecologists. Individual heterogeneity in wild animal populations has been accounted for and quantified by including individually varying effects in models for markârecapture data, but the real need for underlying individual effects to account for observed levels of individual variation has recently been questioned by the work of Tuljapurkar etÂ al. (Ecology Letters, 12, 93, 2009) on dynamic heterogeneity. Modelâselection approaches based on information criteria or Bayes factors have been used to address this question. Here, we suggest that, in addition to modelâselection, modelâchecking methods can provide additional important insights to tackle this issue, as they allow one to evaluate a model's misfit in terms of ecologically meaningful measures. Specifically, we propose the use of posterior predictive checks to explicitly assess discrepancies between a model and the data, and we explain how to incorporate model checking into the inferential process used to assess the practical implications of ignoring individual heterogeneity. Posterior predictive checking is a straightforward and flexible approach for performing model checks in a Bayesian framework that is based on comparisons of observed data to modelâgenerated replications of the data, where parameter uncertainty is incorporated through use of the posterior distribution. If discrepancy measures are chosen carefully and are relevant to the scientific context, posterior predictive checks can provide important information allowing for more efficient model refinement. We illustrate this approach using analyses of vital rates with longâterm markârecapture data for Weddell seals and emphasize its utility for identifying shortfalls or successes of a model at representing a biological process or pattern of interest.}

We provide two examples, beginning with a discussion of band-return models and examining data gathered from observations of blue winged teal (Anas discors), ringed as nestlings. We then look at open population recapture models, focusing on the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, and examine this model in the context of a data set on European dippers (Cinclus cinclus). The Bayesian procedures are shown to be straightforward and provide a convenient framework for model-averaging, which incorporates the uncertainty due to model selection into the inference process. Sufficient detail is provided so that readers who wish to employ the Bayesian approach in this field can do so with ease. An example of BUGS code is also provided.},

  abstract={We present here the final results of the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results are based on a Cepheid calibration of several secondary distance methods applied over the range of about 60-400 Mpc. The analysis presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. We adopt a distance modulus to the LMC (relative to which the more distant galaxies are measured) of Î¼ 0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/553/1/47/img1.gif] {img1.gif} = 18.50 Â± 0.10 mag, or 50 kpc. New, revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid distances, we find values (in km s -1 Mpc -1 ) of H 0 = 71 Â± 2 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/553/1/47/img2.gif] {img2.gif} Â± 6 (systematic) (Type Ia supernovae), H 0 = 71 Â± 3 Â± 7 (Tully-Fisher relation), H 0 = 70 Â± 5 Â± 6 (surface brightness fluctuations), H 0 = 72 Â± 9 Â± 7 (Type II supernovae), and H 0 = 82 Â± 6 Â± 9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results for the different methods with three different weighting schemes, and find good agreement and consistency with H 0 = 72 Â± 8 km s -1 Mpc -1 . Finally, we compare these results with other, global methods for measuring H 0 .}

  abstract={The correlation between the luminosities and rotation velocities of galaxies can be used to estimate distances to late-type galaxies. It is an appropriate moment to reevaluate this method given the great deal of new information available. The major improvements described here include: (1) the template relations can now be defined by large, complete samples, (2) the samples are drawn from a wide range of environments, (3) the relations are defined by photometric information at the B , R , I , and K ' bands, (4) the multiband information clarifies problems associated with internal reddening, (5) the template zero points are defined by 24 galaxies with accurately known distances, and (6) the relations are applied to 12 clusters scattered across the sky and out to velocities of 8000 km s -1 . The biggest change from earlier calibrations are associated with point 5. Roughly a 15% increase in the distance scale has come about with the fivefold increase in the number of zero-point calibrators. The overall increase in the distance scale from the luminosity-line width methodology is about 10% after consideration of all factors. Modulo an assumed distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud of 50 kpc and no metallicity corrections to the Cepheid calibration, the resulting value of the Hubble constant is H 0 = 77 Â± 8 km s -1 Mpc -1 , where the error is the 95% probable statistical error. Cumulative systematic errors internal to this analysis should not exceed 10%. Uncertainties in the distance scale ladder external to this analysis are estimated at ~10%. If the Cepheid calibration is shifted from the LMC to NGC 4258 with a distance established by observations of circumnuclear masers, then H 0 is larger by 12%.}

  abstract={The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) will observe over 1,000,000 galaxies and extended Galactic sources covering the entire sky at wavelengths between 1 and 2 Î¼m. Most of these galaxies will be newly cataloged objects. The survey catalog will have both high completeness and reliability down to J = 15.0 mag and K s = 13.5 mag, equivalent to 1.6 and 2.9 mJy, respectively. Galaxies as small as 10'' are resolved, and those as large as ~2 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] {farcm} 5 are fully imaged. 2MASS will discover galaxies never seen before in the "zone of avoidance" caused by the obscuring effects of Galactic dust and gas, limited only by the extreme number of stars at very low Galactic latitude, especially toward the Galactic center. This paper describes the basic algorithms used to detect and characterize extended sources in the 2MASS database and catalog. Critical procedures include tracking the point-spread function, image background removal, artifact removal, photometry and basic parameterization, star-galaxy discrimination, and object classification using a decision tree technique. We introduce and provide examples of the types of extended sources that 2MASS detects across the sky, including galaxies, Galactic nebulae and resolved stellar objects, multiple stars and clusters, and, finally, artifacts arising from bright stars and transient events. A future paper will provide a full statistical analysis and verification of the completeness, reliability, and integrity of the first release catalog, as well as some of the basic scientific results of the catalog, including galaxy colors, number counts, and redshift distribution.}
